Dr. Santagata’s research aims to identify and target vulnerabilities in tumors to improve patient outcome and survival, focusing on primary brain tumors and tumors that metastasize to the brain. Through genomics, chemical biology, and multiplexed imaging his laboratory explores the fundamental mechanisms that allow tumor cells to develop their most malignant features along with colleagues in the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://labsyspharm.org/) and the [Ludwig Center at Harvard](https://ludwigcenter.hms.harvard.edu/).
